<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>A drought is reported from India and Eastern Africa. Considering the
  amount of water which has recently escaped from clouds over here it is
  not surprising to find that they are feeling the pinch in other
  countries.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A correspondent writes to a weekly paper inquiring when Sir <font
  class="sc">Eric Geddes</font> was born. We admire the fellow's restraint
  in not asking "Why?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We understand that one wealthy connoisseur has decided to give up
  buying Old Masters in order to save up for the purchase of a railway
  ticket.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Daily Mail</i> points out that Lord <font
  class="sc">Northcliffe</font> has left England for the Continent. Sir
  <font class="sc">Eric Geddes</font> is said to have remarked that he will
  catch his lordship coming back.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A gentleman who is about to travel to a South Coast resort writes to
  inquire what his position will be if some future Government reduces the
  railway fares before he arrives at his destination.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In view of the increased railway fares there is some talk of starting
  a Mansion House Fund to convey Scotsmen home from England before it is
  too late.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Of the new railway rates it can be said that those who go farthest
  will fare worse.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>With reference to the man who was seen laughing in the Strand the
  other day, it should be pointed out that he is not an English tax-payer
  but a Colonial who was catching the boat home next morning.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A Christmas-card posted at Farnham in December, 1905, has just been
  delivered at Ivychurch. The theory is that the postal authorities mistook
  it for a business communication.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The monocle is coming into fashion once again, and it is thought that
  a motorist wearing one goggle will soon be quite a common sight.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>In view of their unwieldiness and size it is being urged that motor
  charabancs should be required to carry a special form of hooter, to be
  sounded only when there is no room for a vehicle coming in the other
  direction to pass. A more elaborate system of signals is also suggested,
  notably two short squawks and a long groan, to signify "My pedestrian, I
  think."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a County Court judge it is the duty of every motorist who
  knocks down a pedestrian to go back and ask the man if he is hurt. But
  surely the victim cannot answer such a question off-hand without first
  consulting his solicitor.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A great pilgrimage of house-hunters has visited the enormous marrow
  which is growing in an allotment at Ingatestone, but the strong military
  guard sent to protect it has succeeded up to the present in frustrating
  all attempts to occupy it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A motor fire-engine dashed into a draper's shop in the North of London
  last Tuesday week. We understand that one of the firemen with great
  presence of mind justified his action by immediately setting fire to the
  building.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A petrified fish about fifty feet long has been discovered in Utah.
  This is said to be the largest sardine and the smallest whale America has
  ever produced.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Building operations were interrupted in North London last week, when a
  couple of sparrows built a nest on some foundations just where a
  bricklayer was due to lay a brick the next day.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Six tourists motoring through the mountainous district of Ardèche
  Department fell a thousand feet down a precipice, but escaped without
  injury. We understand that in spite of many tempting offers from
  cinematograph companies the motorists have decided not to repeat the
  experiment.</p>

<h2>SOLVING THE HOLIDAY FARE PROBLEM.</h2>

  <p>"None but the rich can pay the fare" is as true at this moment as when
  the words were first penned.</p>

  <p>The reference, of course, is to the return fare, for the single fare
  of tomorrow is hardly more than we paid without complaint in years gone
  by for the journey there and back.</p>

  <p>How comparatively few people seem to be aware that the solution of the
  difficulty lies in not returning. Could anything be simpler?</p>

  <p>Nobody wants to return. In preparing for a holiday our thoughts are
  concentrated on when to go, where to go and how to get there. Who bothers
  himself about when to come back, where to come back from, and how to do
  it? After all, holiday-making is not to be confused with
  prize-fighting.</p>

  <p>That we have come back in the past has been due as much to custom as
  to anything. Someone introduced the silly fashion of returning from
  holidays, and we have unthinkingly acquired the habit. Once we shake off
  this holiday convention the problem of the return fare is solved.</p>

  <p>Just stay where you are and all will be well. Sooner or later your
  friends or your employer (if your return is really considered desirable)
  will send a money-order. But that is their look-out. The point is that
  the return fare need not trouble <i>you</i>. And you can please yourself
  as to what you buy with the money-order.</p>

  <p>Why all this outcry then about the cost of travelling in the holiday
  season?</p>

<h2>BADLY SYNGED.</h2>

  <p>The scene is the morning-room of the Smith-Hybrows' South London
  residence. It is the day following the final performance of the
  Smith-Hybrows' strenuous season of J.M. <font class="sc">Synge</font>
  drama, undertaken with the laudable intention of familiarising the suburb
  with the <i>real</i> Irish temperament and the works of the dramatist in
  question.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Smith-Hybrow is seated at the breakfast-table, her head buried
  behind the coffee urn. She is opening her letters and "keening" softly as
  she rocks in her chair.</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. Smith-Hybrow</i> (<i>scanning a letter</i>). Will I be helping
  them with the sale of work? It's little enough the like of me will be
  doing for them the way I was treated at the last Bazaar, when Mrs.
  McGupperty and Mrs. Glyn-Jones were after destroying me with the cutting
  of the sandwiches. And was I not there for three days, from the rising of
  the blessed sun to the shining of the blessed stars, cutting and cutting,
  and never a soul to bear witness to the destroying labour of it, and the
  two legs of me like to give way with the great weariness (<i>keens</i>)?
  I'll have no call this year to be giving in to their prayers and
  beseechings, and I won't care the way the Curate will be after trying to
  come round me, with his eyes looking at me the way the moon kisses the
  drops of dew on the hedgerows when the road is white.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[<i>Opens another letter, keening the while in a slightly higher key.
  Enter</i> Gertrude Smith-Hybrow. <i>She crosses to the window and stares
  out.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Gertrude.</i> There are black clouds in the sky, and the wind is
  breaking in the west and making a great stir with the trees, and they are
  hitting one on the other. And there is rain falling, falling from the
  clouds, and the roads be wet.</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. S.-H.</i> It is your mackintosh you will be wanting when you
  are after going to the Stores.</p>

  <p><i>Gertrude</i> (<i>coming to the table and speaking with dull
  resentment</i>). And why should I be going to the Stores the way I have
  enough to do with a meeting of the League for Brighter Homes and a
  luncheon of the Cubist Encouragement Society? Isn't it a queer hard thing
  that Dora cannot be going to the Stores, and her with time enough on her
  hands surely?</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[<i>Sits in her place and begins keening. While she has been speaking
  Dora has entered hurriedly, buttoning her jumper.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Dora</i> (<i>vigorously</i>). And is it you, Gertrude Smith-Hybrow,
  that will be talking about me having time on my hands? May the saints
  forgive you for the hard words, and me having to cycle this blessed day
  to Mrs. Montgomery's lecture on the Dadaist Dramatists, and the méringues
  and the American creams to be made for to-night's Tchekoff Conversazione.
  Is it not enough for a girl to be destroyed with the play-acting, and the
  wind like to be in my face the whole way and the rain falling,
  falling?</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[<i>Sits in her place and keens.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Mrs. S.-H.</i> (<i>after an interval of keening</i>). Is it your
  father that will be missing his train this morning, Dora
  Smith-Hybrow?</p>

  <p><i>Dora</i> (<i>rousing herself and selecting an egg</i>). It is my
  father that will be missing his train entirely, and it is his son that
  would this minute be sleeping the blessed daylight away had I not let
  fall upon him a sponge that I had picked out of the cold, cold water.</p>

  <p><i>Gertrude.</i> It is a flapper you are, Dora Smith-Hybrow.</p>

  <p><i>Dora.</i> It is a flapper you will never be again, Gertrude
  Smith-Hybrow, though you be after doing your queer best to look like
  one.</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. S.-H.</i> Whisht! Is it the time for loose talk, with the wind
  rising, rising, and the rain falling, falling, and the price of butter up
  another threepence this blessed morning?</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[<i>They all three recommence keening. Enter</i> Mr. Smith-Hybrow
  <i>followed by</i> Cyril.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Mr. S.-H.</i> (<i>staunching a gash in his chin</i>). Is it not a
  hard thing for a man to be late for his breakfast and the rain falling,
  falling, and the wind rising, rising. It's destroyed I am with the loss
  of blood and no food in my stomach would keep the life in a flea.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[<i>Sits in his place and opens his letters savagely.</i> Cyril, <i>a
  cadaverous youth, stares gloomily into the depths of the
  marmalade.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Cyril</i> (<i>dreamily</i>). There's gold and gold and
  gold&mdash;caverns of gold. And there's a woman with hair of gold and
  eyes would pick the locks of a man's soul, and long shining hands like
  pale seaweed. Is it not a terrible thing that a man would have to go to
  the City when there is a woman with gold hair waiting for him in the
  marmalade pot&mdash;waiting to draw him down into the cold, cold
  water?</p>

  <p><i>Dora.</i> Is it another spongeful you are wanting, Cyril
  Smith-Hybrow, and myself destroyed entirely waiting for the
  marmalade?</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[Cyril <i>blushes, passes the marmalade, sits down languidly and
  selects an egg.</i> Mrs. S.-H. <i>pours out the coffee and resumes her
  keening.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Mr. S.-H.</i> (<i>glaring at her</i>). Is it not a nice thing for
  the wife of a respectable City stockbroker to sit at the breakfast-table
  making a noise like that of a cow that is waiting to be milked?</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. S.-H.</i> (<i>hurt</i>). It is keening I am.</p>

  <p><i>Gertrude</i> (<i>passing him "The Morning Post"</i>). Is it not
  enough that the price of butter is up another threepence this blessed
  day, and the wind rising, rising, and the rain falling, falling?</p>

  <p><i>Mr. S.-H.</i> It is destroyed we shall all be entirely.</p>

  <p><i>Cyril</i> (<i>gazing into the depths of his egg</i>). There was a
  strange queer dream I was after having the night that has gone. It was on
  the rocks I was....</p>

  <p><i>Mr. S.-H.</i> (<i>glaring at the market reports</i>). It is on the
  rocks we shall all be.</p>

  <p><i>Cyril.</i> ... on the rocks I was by the sea-shore ...</p>

  <p><i>Dora</i> (<i>slightly hysterically</i>). With the wind rising,
  rising?</p>

  <p><i>Cyril</i> (<i>nodding</i>). ... and the rain falling, falling. And
  a woman of the chorus drove up in a taxi, and the man that had the
  driving of it was eating an orange. The woman came and sat by the side of
  me, and the peroxide in her hair made it gleam like the pale gold coins
  that were in the banks before the Great War (<i>more dreamily</i>). Never
  a word said she when I hung a chain of cold, cold sausages about her
  neck, but her eyes were shining, shining, and into my hands she put a tin
  of corned beef. And it is destroyed I was with the love of her, and would
  have kissed her lips but I saw the park-keeper coming, coming out of the
  sea for tickets, and I fled from the strange queer terror of it, and
  found myself by a lamp-post in Hackney Wick with the wind rising, rising,
  and the rain falling, falling.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[<i>He stops. The others stare at him and at one another in piteous
  inquiry. The women begin keening.</i> Mr. S.-H. <i>seizes the remaining
  egg and cracks it viciously.</i></p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><i>Mr. S.-H.</i> (<i>falling back in his chair</i>). Damnation!</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>[<i>The air is filled with a pungent matter-of-fact odour.</i> Dora,
  <i>holding her handkerchief to her nose, rushes valiantly at the offender
  and hurls it out of the window on to a flower-bed. The</i> <font

<h2>THE SUCCULENT COMEDIANS.</h2>

  <p>Among the literary and artistic treasures of American collectors the
  manuscript of <font class="sc">Lamb's</font> essay on Roast Pig is
  eminent. I have seen this rarity, which is now in the strong room where
  Mr. <font class="sc">Pierpont Morgan</font> keeps his autographs safe
  equally from fire and from theft&mdash;if not from the desire to thieve.
  Much did I covet in this realm of steel, and <font
  class="sc">Lamb's</font> MS. not least. The essay occupies both sides of
  large sheets of foolscap, written in a minute hand, with very few
  corrections, both the paper and the time occupied in transcription, if
  not also in actual composition, being, I should guess, the East India
  Company's. It is not, I imagine, the first draft, but the first fair copy
  after all the changes had been made and the form was fixed; and its
  author, if he is in any position to know what is going forward on a
  planet which he left some six-and-eighty years ago, must have been amused
  when he heard that so much money&mdash;thousands and thousands of
  dollars&mdash;had been given for it at auction the other day.</p>

  <p>Reading the essay again, in the faded ink on the yellowing paper, I
  realised once more that everything that can be said about little pigs,
  dead and ripe for the eater, had been said here and said finally. But the
  living? That very evening I was to find little live pigs working for
  their maintenance under conditions of which I had never dreamed, in an
  environment less conducive, one would suppose, to porcine activity than
  any that could be selected.</p>

  <p>It was at Coney Island, that astonishing permanent and magnified
  Earl's Court Exhibition, summer Blackpool and
  August-Bank-Holiday-Hampstead-Heath, which New York supports for its
  beguilement. In this domain of switchbacks and chutes, merry-go-rounds
  and shooting-galleries, dancing-halls and witching waves, vociferous and
  crowded and lit by a million lamps, I came suddenly upon the Pig Slide
  and had a new conception of what quadrupeds can do for man.</p>

  <p>The Pig Slide, which was in one of the less noisy quarters of Luna
  Park, consisted of an enclosure in which stood a wooden building of two
  storeys, some five yards wide and three high. On the upper storey was a
  row of six or eight cages, in each of which dwelt a little live pig, an
  infant of a few weeks. In the middle of the row, descending to the
  ground, was an inclined board, with raised edges, such as is often
  installed in swimming-baths to make diving automatic, and beneath each
  cage was a hole a foot in diameter. The spectators and participants
  crowded outside the enclosure, and the thing was to throw balls, which
  were hired for the purpose, into the holes. Nothing could exceed the
  alert and eager interest taken by the little pigs in the efforts of the
  ball-throwers. They quivered on their little legs; they pressed their
  little noses against the bars of the cages; their little eyes sparkled;
  their tails (the only corkscrews left in America) curled and uncurled and
  curled again: and with reason, for whereas, if you missed&mdash;as was
  only too easy&mdash;nothing happened, if you threw accurately the fun
  began, and the fun was also theirs.</p>

  <p>This is what occurred. First a bell rang and then a spring released
  the door of the cage immediately over the hole which your ball had
  entered, so that it swung open. The little pig within, after watching the
  previous infirmity of your aim with dejection, if not contempt, had
  pricked up his ears on the sound of the bell, and now smiled a gratified
  smile, irresistible in infectiousness, and trotted out, and, with the
  smile dissolving into an expression of <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> absolute beatitude, slid
  voluptuously down the plank: to be gathered in at the foot by an
  attendant and returned to its cage all ready for another such
  adventure.</p>

  <p>It was for these moments and their concomitant changes of countenance
  that you paid your money. To taste the triumph of good marksmanship was
  only a fraction of your joy; the greater part of it consisted in
  liberating a little prisoner and setting in motion so much ecstasy.</p>

  <p>We do not use baby pigs in this entertaining way in England. At the
  most we hunt them greased. But when other beguilements weary we might.
  The R.S.P.C.A. could not object, the little pets are so happy. And what a
  privilege is theirs, both alive and dead, to enchant creation's lord.</p>

      <p>All alone I went a-walking by the London Docks one day,</p>
      <p>For to see the ships discharging in the basins where they lay;</p>
      <p>And the cargoes that I saw there they were every sort and kind,</p>
      <p>Every blessed brand of merchandise a man could bring to mind;</p>
      <p>There were things in crates and boxes, there was stuff in bags and bales,</p>
      <p>There were tea-chests wrapped in matting, there were Eastern-looking frails,</p>
      <p>There were baulks of teak and greenheart, there were stacks of spruce and pine,</p>
      <p>There was cork and frozen carcasses and casks of Spanish wine,</p>
      <p>There was rice and spice and cocoa-nuts, and rum enough was there</p>

      <p>There was one that took my fancy first and foremost of them all;</p>
      <p>It was neither choice nor costly, it was neither rich nor rare</p>

<h3>ROSES ALL THE WAY.</h3>

  <p>Fired by an Irish rose-grower's pictures of some of his beautiful new
  seedlings we are tempted to describe one or two of our own favourite
  flowers in language similar to his own. This is an example of the way he
  does it:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>"<font class="sc">Lady Maureen Stewart</font> (<i>Hybrid
  Tea</i>).&mdash;A gloriously-finished globular slightly imbricated cupped
  bloom with velvety black scarlet cerise shell-shaped petals, whose reflex
  is solid pure orangey maroon without veining. An excellent bloom, ideal
  shape, brilliant and non-fading colour with heavy musk rose odour. Erect
  growth and flower-stalk. Foliage wax and leathery and not too large. A
  very floriferous and beautiful rose. 21<i>s.</i> each."</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Why not also these?&mdash;</p>

  <p><font class="sc">David</font> (<i>Hybrid Tory-Lib.</i>).&mdash;A
  gloriously-finished true-blue-slightly-imbricated-with-red-flag coalition
  rose whose deep globular head with ornate decorative calyx retains its
  perfect exhibition-cross-question-hostile-amendment symmetry of form
  without blueing or burning in the hottest Westminster sun. Its smiling
  peach and cerise endearments terminating in black scarlet shell-shaped
  waxy Berlin ultimata are carried on an admirably rigid peduncle. Equally
  vigorous in all parts of Europe. Superbly rampant. Not on sale.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Austen</font> (<i>Tea and most other
  things</i>).&mdash;This bottomless-cupped
  bank-paper-white-edged-and-rimmed-with-tape-pink-margin bloom, the reflex
  of whose never-fading demand notes is velvety black thunder-cloud with
  lightning-flash six-months-in-the-second-division veinations, has never
  been known to be too full. It is supported by a landlordly stalk of the
  utmost excess-profits-war-profits-minor-profits rigidity. A decorative,
  acquisitive and especially captivating rose, and already something more
  than a popular favourite. 18<i>s.</i> in £1.</p>

  <p><font class="sc">Sir Thomas</font> (<i>Ceylon and India
  Tea</i>).&mdash;This true sport from the British bull-dog rose has a
  slightly globular double-hemisphere-popular
  greatly-desiring-and-deserving-to-be-cupped bloom whose pearly preserved
  cream flesh is delicately flushed and mottled with tinned salmon and
  dried apricot. Rich golden and banking-account stamina, foliage deep navy
  blue with brass buttons and a superb fragrance of western ocean. Its
  marvellous try-try-try-again floriferousness in all weathers is the
  admiration of all beholders. Price no object.</p>

<h2>QUEEN'S COUNSEL.</h2>

  <p>The Fairy Queen shook her head in answer to my question. "No," she
  said, "I have no favourite flower."</p>

  <p>She had dropped in after dinner, as was her occasional habit, and at
  the moment sat perched on a big red carnation which stood in a
  flower-glass on the top of my desk.</p>

  <p>"You see," she continued, floating across to where I was sitting and
  lowering her voice confidentially, for there were a good many flowers
  about&mdash;"you see it would never do. Just think of the trouble it
  would cause. Imagine the state of mind of the lilies if I were to show a
  preference for roses. There's always been a little jealousy there, and
  they're all frightfully touchy. The artistic temperament, you know. Why,
  I daren't even sleep in the same flower two nights running."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see," I said. "It must be very awkward."</p>

  <p>I lapsed into silence; I had had a worrying day and was feeling tired
  and a little depressed. The Queen fluttered about the room, pausing a
  moment on the mantel-shelf for a word or two with her old friend the
  Dresden china shepherdess. Then she came back to the desk and performed a
  brief <i>pas seul</i> on the shining smooth cover of my pass-book. My
  mind flew instantly to my slender bank-balance and certain recent
  foolishnesses.</p>

  <p>"Talking of favourites," I said&mdash;"talking of favourites, do you
  take any interest in racing?"</p>

  <p>Instantly the Queen subsided on to my rubber stamp damper, which was
  fortunately dry.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," she replied, "I take a <i>great</i> interest in racing. I
  love it. I can give you all sorts of hints."</p>

  <p>I thought it was a pity she hadn't called a week or two earlier. I
  might have been a richer woman by a good many pounds.</p>

  <p>"And there are so many kinds," continued the Queen earnestly. "Now in
  a butterfly race it's always best just to hold on and let them do as they
  like. It's not a bit of use trying to make them go straight. Rabbits are
  better in that way, but even rabbits are a little uncertain at times.
  Full of nerves. But have you ever tried swallow-racing?" she went on
  enthusiastically. "It's simply splendid. You give them their heads and
  you never know <i>where</i> you may get to. But, anyway, it doesn't
  really matter in the least afterwards who wins; it's only while it's
  happening that you feel so thrilled, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>I didn't acquiesce very whole-heartedly. I'm afraid my thoughts were
  with my lost guineas. It <i>had</i> rather mattered afterwards. I really
  had been very foolish.</p>

  <p>"You look depressed," said the Fairy Queen. "Can I help you? I'm
  really extremely practical. You know, don't you," she leaned forward and
  looked at me earnestly, "that I should be delighted if I could assist you
  with any advice?"</p>

  <p>I hesitated. Just before she came I had been anxiously considering as
  to how I was going to make one hundred pounds do the work of two during
  the next few weeks; but somehow I didn't quite like to mention such
  material matters to the Queen; it didn't seem suitable.</p>

  <p>I looked up and met her kind eyes fixed on mine with an expression of
  the gentlest interest and solicitude.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," I said, still hesitating, "whether you know anything about
  stocks and shares?"</p>

  <p>"Stocks and shares," she repeated slowly, looking just a little vague
  and puzzled. And then&mdash;"Oh, yes, of course I do, if that's all you
  want to know."</p>

  <p>I felt quite pleased now that I had really got it out.</p>

  <p>"If you could just give me a useful hint or two I should be
  tremendously grateful," I said. Already thousands loomed entrancingly
  before me. Already I saw myself settled in that darling cottage on the
  windy hill above Daccombe Wood. Already&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I think I had better get a pencil and paper," I said. "My memory's
  dreadful."</p>

  <p>But the Fairy Queen shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'll write it down for you," she said, "and you can read it when I'm
  gone. That's so much more fun. But I don't need paper."</p>

  <p>She drew a tiny shining implement from her pocket and, picking up a
  couple of rose-petals which had fallen upon the table, she busied herself
  with them for a moment at my desk, her mouth pursed up, her brows
  contracted in an expression of intense seriousness.</p>

  <p>"There," she said, "that's that. And now show me <i>all</i> your new
  clothes."</p>

  <p>We spent quite a pleasant evening over one thing and another, and I
  forgot all about the rose-leaves until after she had gone; but when I
  came back to my empty sitting-room they shone in the dusk with a soft
  radiance which came, I discovered, from the writing on them. It glowed
  like those luminous figures on watches which were so entrancing when they
  first appeared. I had never realised before that they were fairy
  figures.</p>

  <p>I spread the petals out on my palm, feeling quite excited at the
  prospect of making my fortune by such means, though I was a little
  anxious as to how I was going to make use of the information I was about
  to acquire.</p>

  <p>"I will ask Cousin Fred," I decided (Cousin Fred being a stockbroker),
  and I smiled a little to myself as I thought how amazed and possibly
  amused my dapper cousin would be when he learnt the source of my
  knowledge. He might even refuse to believe in it&mdash;and then where
  should I be?</p>

  <p>I needn't have troubled. When I unfolded my rose-petals this is what I
  read:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>Stocks.</i>&mdash;The white ones are much the best and have by far
  the sweetest scent.</p>

  <p><i>Shares.</i>&mdash;<i>Always</i> go shares."</p>

<h2>HEART OF MINE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Being a rather hysterical contribution
from our Analytical Novelist.</i>)</p>

  <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;I suppose one never realises till one is actually
  dead how nearly dead one can be without actually being it. You see what I
  mean? No. Well, how blithely, how recklessly one rollicks through life,
  fondly believing that one is in the best of health, in the prime of
  condition, and all the time one is the unconscious victim of some fatal
  infirmity or disease. I mean, take my own case. I went to see my doctor
  in order to be cured of hay fever. He examined my heart. He made me take
  off my shirt. He hammered my chest; he rapped my ribs with his knuckles
  to see if they sounded hollow. I don't know why he did this, but I think
  he was at one time attached to a detective and has got into the habit of
  looking for secret passages and false panels and so on.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, he suspected my chest, and he listened at it for so long that
  any miscreant who had been concealed in it would have had to give himself
  away by coughing or blowing his nose.</p>

  <p>After a long time he said, "Your heart's dilated. You want a complete
  rest. Don't work. Don't smoke. Don't drink. Don't eat. Don't do anything.
  Take plenty of exercise. Sit perfectly still. Don't mope. Don't rush
  about. Take this before and after every meal. Only don't have any meals."
  I laughed at him. I knew my heart was perfectly sound, much sounder than
  most men's. I went home. I didn't even have the prescription made up.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Now comes the tragic thing. <i>That very night
  I realised that he was right.</i> There <i>is</i> something wrong with my
  heart. It is too long. It is too wide. It is too thick. It is out of
  place. It would be difficult to say <i>exactly</i> where the measurements
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> are
  wrong, but one has a sort of <i>sense</i> ... you know?... One can feel
  that it is too large.... A swollen feeling.... Somehow I never felt this
  before; I never even felt that it was there ... but now I always know
  that it is there&mdash;trying to get out.... I put my hand on it and can
  feel it definitely expanding&mdash;like a football bladder. Sometimes I
  think it wants to get out at my collar-bone; sometimes I think it will
  blow out under my bottom rib; sometimes some other way. It is
  terrible....</p>

  <p>I have had the prescription made up.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;The way it beats! Sometimes very fast and heavy
  and emphatic, like a bad barrage of 5.9's. Fortunately my watch has a
  second-hand, so that I can time it&mdash;forty-five to the half-minute,
  ninety-five to the full minute. Then I know that the end is very near;
  everyone knows that the normal rate for a healthy adult heart is
  seventy-two. Then sometimes it goes very slow, very dignified and faint,
  as when some great steamer glides in at slow speed to her anchorage, and
  the engines thump in a subdued and profound manner very far away, or as
  when at night the solemn tread of some huge policeman is heard, remote
  and soft and dilated&mdash;I mean dilatory, or as when&mdash;But you see
  what I mean.</p>

  <p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;How was it, I wonder, that all this was hidden
  from me for so long? And now what am I to do? I am a doomed man. With a
  heart like this I cannot last long. I have resigned my clubs; I have
  given up my work. I can think of nothing but this dull pain, this heavy
  throbbing at my side. My work&mdash;ha! Yesterday I met another young
  doctor at tea. He asked me if there was any "murmur." I said I did not
  know&mdash;no one had told me. But after tea I went away and listened.
  Yes, there was a murmur; I could hear it plainly. I told the young
  doctor. He said that murmurs were not considered so important nowadays.
  What matters is "the reaction of the heart to work." By that test I am
  doomed indeed. But the murmur is better.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I have told Anton Gregorovitch Gregorski. He
  says he has a heart too.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I have been learning things to-day. I am worse
  even than the doctor thought. In a reference book in the dining-room
  there is a medical dictionary. It says: "Dilatation leads to dropsy,
  shortness of breath and blueness of the face." I have got some of those
  already. I have never seen a face so blue. It is like the sea in the
  early morning.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;The heart is bigger again to-day&mdash;about an
  inch each way. The weight of it is terrible to carry.... I have to take
  taxis.... This evening it was going at thirty-two to the minute....</p>

  <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Last night, when I tried to count the beats, I
  could not find it.... It must have stopped.... Anton Gregorovitch says it

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

  <p><i>Monday, July 26th.</i>&mdash;When the Peers were about to discuss
  the Law of Property Bill, which seeks to abolish the distinction between
  land and other property, Lord <font class="sc">Cave</font> dropped a
  bombshell into the Committee by moving to omit the whole of Part I. Lords
  <font class="sc">Haldane</font> and <font class="sc">Buckmaster</font>
  were much upset and loudly protested against the proposal to cut out "the
  very heart and substance of the measure." The <font class="sc">Lord
  Chancellor</font> was less perturbed by the explosion and was confident
  that after further discussion he could induce the <font
  class="sc">Cave</font>-dwellers to come into line with modern
  requirements. Thirty-four clauses thus disappeared with a bang; and of
  the hundred and odd remaining only one gave much trouble. Objection was
  taken to Clause 101, granting the public full rights of access to
  commons, on the grounds <i>inter alia</i> that it would give too much
  freedom to gipsies and too little to golfers. Lord <font
  class="sc">Salisbury</font>, who, like the counsel in a famous legal
  story, claimed to "know a little about manors," was sure that only the
  lord could deal faithfully with the Egyptians, but, fortified by Lord
  <font class="sc">Haldane's</font> assurance that the clause gave the
  public no more rights and the lords of the manor no less than they had
  before, the House passed it by 42 to 29.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Bridgeman</font>, for the Board of Trade, bore
  the brunt of the early questioning in the House of Commons. He sustained
  with equal imperturbability the assaults of the Tariff Reformers, who
  asserted that British toy-making&mdash;an "infant industry" if ever there
  was one&mdash;was being stifled by foreign imports: and those of the Free
  Traders, who objected to the Government's efforts to resuscitate the
  dyeing trade.</p>

  <p>The alarming rumours in the Sunday papers about the <font
  class="sc">Prime Minister's</font> state of health were effectively
  dispelled by his appearance on the Front Opposition, a little
  weary-looking, no doubt, but as alert as ever to seize the weak point in
  the adversary's case and to put his own in the most favourable light.
  From the enthusiasm of his announcement that the Soviet Government had
  accepted our invitation to attend a Conference in London, one would have
  thought that the Bolshevists had agreed to the British proposals
  unconditionally and that peace&mdash;"that is what the world
  wants"&mdash;was now assured.</p>

  <p>Abhorrence of the Government of Ireland Bill is the one subject on
  which all Irishmen appear to think alike. It is, no doubt, with the
  desire to preserve that unanimity that the <font class="sc">Prime
  Minister</font> announced his intention of pressing the measure forward
  after the Recess "with all possible despatch."</p>

  <p>But before that date it looks as if Irishmen would have despatched one
  another. The little band of Nationalists had handed in a batch of
  private-notice Questions arising out of the disturbances in Belfast.
  Their description of them as the outcome of an organised attack upon
  Catholics was indignantly challenged by the Ulstermen, and the <font
  class="sc">Speaker</font> had hard work to maintain order. The contest
  was renewed on a motion for the adjournment. As a means of bringing peace
  to Ireland the debate was absolutely futile. But it enabled Mr. <font
  class="sc">Devlin</font> to fire off one of his tragical-comical
  orations, and Sir H. <font class="sc">Greenwood</font> to disclaim the
  accusation that he had treated the Irish problem with levity. "There is
  nothing light and airy about me," he declared; and no one who has heard
  his pronunciation of the word "Belfast" would doubt it.</p>

  <p>Before and after this melancholy interlude good progress was made with
  the Finance Bill, and Mr. <font class="sc">Chamberlain</font> made
  several further concessions to the "family-man."</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, July 27th.</i>&mdash;The Lords rejected the Health Resorts
  and Watering Places Bill under which local authorities could have raised
  a penny rate for advertising purposes. Lord <font
  class="sc">Southwark's</font> well-meant endeavour to support the Bill by
  reminding the House that Irish local authorities had enjoyed this power
  since 1909 was perhaps the proximate cause of its defeat, for it can
  hardly be said that the last few weeks have enhanced the reputation of
  Ireland as a health resort.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Harmsworth</font> utterly confounded the critics
  of the Passport Office. Its staff may appear preposterously large and its
  methods unduly dilatory, but the fact remains that it is one of the few
  public departments that actually pays its way. Last year it spent
  thirty-seven thousand pounds and took ninety-one thousand pounds in fees.
  "See the world and help to pay for the War" should be the motto over its
  portals.</p>

  <p>It is, of course, quite proper that soldiers who wreck the property of
  civilians&mdash;albeit under great provocation&mdash;should receive
  suitable punishment. But a sailor is hardly the man to press for it.
  Lieutenant-Commander <font class="sc">Kenworthy</font> received a
  much-needed lesson in etiquette when Major <font
  class="sc">Jameson</font> gravely urged, in his penetrating Scotch voice,
  that soldiers in Ireland should be ordered not to distract the prevailing
  peace and quiet of that country, but should keep to their proper function
  of acting as targets for Sinn Fein bullets.</p>

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Chamberlain</font> dealt very gingerly with Sir
  <font class="sc">Arthur Fell's</font> inquiry as to whether "any ordinary
  individual can understand the forms now sent out by the Income Tax
  Department?" Fearing that if he replied in the affirmative he would be
  asked to solve some particularly abstruse conundrum, he contented himself
  with saying that the forms were complicated because the tax was
  complicated, and the tax was complicated because of the number and
  variety of the reliefs granted to the taxpayer. It does not seem to have
  occurred <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg
  94]</span> to him that it is the duty of the <font class="sc">Chancellor
  of the Exchequer</font> to make the tax simple as well as equitable. Is
  it conceivable that he can have forgotten <font class="sc">Adam
  Smith'</font>s famous maxims on the subject, and particularly this: "The
  time of payment, the manner of payment, the quantity to be paid, ought
  all to be clear and plain to the contributor, and to every other
  person"?</p>

    <p>MR. BONAR LAW PACKS HIS TRUNKS.</p>
  </div>
  <p>The House did not rise till half-past one this morning, and was again
  faced with a long night's work. In vain Sir <font class="sc">Donald
  Maclean</font> protested against the practice of taking wee sma' Bills in
  the wee sma' oors. Mr. <font class="sc">Bonar Law</font> was obdurate. He
  supposed the House had not abandoned all hope of an Autumn recess. Well,
  then, had not the poet said that the best of all ways to lengthen our
  days was to steal a few hours from the night?</p>

  <p>The Report stage of the Finance Bill was finished off, but not until
  the Government had experienced some shocks. The Corporation tax, intended
  partially to fill the yawning void which will be caused some day by the
  disappearance of E.P.D.&mdash;on the principle that one bad tax deserves
  another&mdash;was condemned with equal vigour, but for entirely different
  reasons, by Colonel <font class="sc">Wedgwood</font> and Sir F. <font
  class="sc">Banbury</font>. They "told" together against it and had the
  satisfaction of bringing the Government majority down to fifty-five.</p>

  <p>The champions of the Co-operative Societies also put up a strong fight
  against the proposal to make their profits, for the first time, subject
  to taxation. Mr. <font class="sc">Chamberlain</font> declined, however,
  to put them in a privileged position as compared with other traders, but
  carried his point only by sixty-one votes.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, July 28th.</i>&mdash;In spite of the limitation of
  Questions the Member for Central Hull still manages to extract a good
  deal of information from the Treasury Bench. This afternoon he learned
  from Mr. <font class="sc">Long</font> that the Board of Admiralty was not
  created solely for the purpose of satisfying his curiosity; and from Mr.
  <font class="sc">Kellaway</font> that the equipment of even the most
  versatile Under-Secretary does not include the gift of prophecy.</p>

  <p>At long last the House learned the Government decision regarding the
  increase in railway fares. It is to come into force on August 6th, by
  which time the most belated Bank-Holiday-maker should have returned from
  his revels. Mr. <font class="sc">Bonar Law</font> appended to the
  announcement a surely otiose explanation of the necessity of the
  increase. Everybody knows that railways are being run at a loss, due in
  the main to the increased wages of miners and railway-men. Mr. <font
  class="sc">Thomas</font> rather weakly submitted that an important factor
  was the larger number of men employed, and was promptly met with the
  retort that that was because of the shorter hours worked.</p>

  <p>Cheered by the statement of its Leader that he still hoped to get the
  adjournment by August 14th the House plunged with renewed zest into the
  final stage of the Finance Bill. Mr. <font class="sc">Bottomley</font>,
  whose passion for accuracy is notorious, inveighed against the lack of
  this quality in the Treasury Estimates. As for the war-debt, since the
  Government had failed to "make Germany pay," he urged that the principal
  burden should be left for posterity to shoulder.</p>

  <p>These sentiments rather shocked Mr. <font class="sc">Asquith</font>,
  who, while mildly critical of Government methods, was all in favour of
  "severe, stringent, drastic taxation." Mr. <font
  class="sc">Chamberlain</font> repeated his now familiar lecture to the
  House of Commons, which, while accusing the Government of extravagance,
  was always pressing for new forms of expenditure. In the study of economy
  he dislikes abstractions&mdash;except from the pockets of the
  taxpayer.</p>

<h2>THE BIRTHDAY PRESENT.</h2>

  <p>I went into the morning-room with a worried frown upon my brow.
  Kathleen was doing the accounts at the table.</p>

  <p>"Kathleen," I said, "it's Veronica's birthday on Wednesday
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What did you say seven eighths were?" said Kathleen. "I asked you
  last week."</p>

  <p>"I can't possibly carry complicated calculations in my head from week
  to week," I said; "you should have made a note of it at the time. It's
  Veronica's birthday on Wednesday, and what do you think she wants?"</p>

  <p>But Kathleen was enthralled by the greengrocer's book. "Have we really
  had eight cabbages this week?" she said. "We must, I suppose.
  Greengrocers are generally honest; they live so near to nature. Well,
  now," she shut up her books, "what were you saying, dear?"</p>

  <p>I sighed, cleared my throat and began again. "It's Veronica's birthday
  on Wednesday, and what do you think she wants? She wants," I said
  dramatically, "a 'frush' from the bird-shop in the village. The ones that
  hang in cages outside the door."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Kathleen, "why not?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" I became more than serious. "A daughter of ours has
  demanded for a plaything a caged bird. Psychologically it is an important
  occasion. Now or never must she learn to look upon a caged bird with
  horror. What I am thinking of is the psychological effect upon the
  child's character. The psychological&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You needn't worry about Veronica's psychology," said Kathleen.
  "Veronica's psychology is in the right place."</p>

  <p>"You misunderstand the meaning of the word," I said loftily. "However,
  if you wish to wash your hands of Veronica's training, if you refuse to
  cope with your own child, I must take it upon myself."</p>

  <p>"Do," said Kathleen sweetly; "I'll listen."</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It was Veronica's birthday. We were outside the bird-shop. The
  thrushes in cages hung around the door.</p>

  <p>Veronica lifted grave blue eyes to me trustingly. "You promised me a
  frush, darlin'," she said.</p>

  <p>Veronica is small for her name and has a disarming habit of
  introducing terms of endearment into her conversation.</p>

  <p>"You didn't quite understand me," I said gently. "I said I'd think
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that means promising, doesn't it? Finking about it
  <i>means</i> promising. I <i>fought</i> you meant promising. <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> I fought
  all night you meant promising. Darlin'." The last word was a sentence all
  by itself.</p>

  <p>Kathleen raised her eyebrows when we came out with the bird in the
  cage.</p>

  <p>"This isn't quite the moment," I said with dignity; "it's best to let
  her get it first and realise afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Let's all go to Crown Hill now," said Veronica in a voice that
  admitted of no denial.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We were on Crown Hill. Veronica had hugged the cage to her small bosom
  all the way, making little reassuring noises to its occupant.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Kathleen, "hadn't you better begin? Isn't this the
  psycho&mdash;you know what moment?"</p>

  <p>I took a deep breath and began.</p>

  <p>"Veronica," I said, "listen to me for a moment. If you were a little
  bird&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But she wasn't listening to me. She had held up the little wooden
  cage, opened the clasp of the door and, with a rapt smile on her small
  shining face, was watching the "frush" as he soared into the air with a
  sudden burst of song.</p>

  <p>We none of us spoke till he had vanished from sight. Then Veronica
  broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"It's all my very own plan," she said proudly. "I planned it all by
  myself. An' all my birfdays I'm going to have one of that nasty man's
  frushes for a present, and we'll all free come up here and let it
  out&mdash;always an' always an' for ever an' ever&mdash;right up till I'm
  a hundred."</p>

  <p>"Why stop at a hundred?" I murmured, recovering myself with an
  effort.</p>

  <p>But I could not escape Kathleen's eye.</p>

  <p>"I hope you feel small," it said.</p>

  <p>I did.</p>

<h2>VADE MECUMS.</h2>

  <p>I have invented a new sort of patience. It is called Vade Mecums. The
  rules are quite simple and all the plant you need for it is a "Vade
  Mecum" traveller's handbook and a complete ignorance of all languages but
  your own. Get one of these fascinating little classics, a passport and a
  single to Boulogne, and you can begin at once.</p>

  <p>The game consists in firing off (in the local lingo) every single
  phrase that occurs in the book. The only other rule in the game is that
  the occasion for making each remark must be reasonably apposite. You need
  not keep to the order in the book and no points are awarded for
  pronunciation, provided that the party addressed shows by word or deed
  that he (or she) has understood you. By way of illustration I will give
  some account of my first experiments in this enthralling pastime.</p>

  <p>As it happened I was able to start at once&mdash;too soon, in fact, to
  be altogether comfortable. We had scarcely put out from Folkestone before
  I got my chance. The sea was distinctly rough, but I just had time to
  open my Vade Mecum at page 228 (sub-heading, "On embarking and what
  happens at sea"), and to read to a passing French steward the first
  sentence that caught my eye. It was as follows: "The wind is very
  violent; the sea is very rough; the waves are very high; the rolling of
  the vessel makes my head ache; I am very much inclined to be sick."</p>

  <p>After that I made no more progress till we reached Boulogne; but from
  the steward's subsequent actions I judged that he had understood; so I
  was one up.</p>

  <p>My Vade Mecum, like most of its kind, was unfortunately compiled many
  years ago and had never been brought up to date. This, of course, saved
  me the expense of having to hire aeroplanes or even motor-cars, but it
  landed me in quite a number of difficulties at the opposite extreme, as
  you will see.</p>

  <p>For instance, in order to polish off the heading, "Of what may happen
  on the road," I was compelled to obtain a carriage. Judge then my joy
  when, on reaching a carriage builder's, I discovered a whole section
  tucked away in a corner of the book dealing exclusively with that very
  topic. I can think of no other conceivable circumstances under which I
  could have said, "The wheels are in a miserable state; the body is too
  heavy; the springs are too light; the shafts are too short; the pole is
  too thin; the shape is altogether old-fashioned, and the seats are both
  high and uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>Yet now I said it all&mdash;in two halves, it is true, and in two
  different shops; but still I said it all. The first half cost me three
  front teeth, which fell out while the outraged <i>carrossier</i> was
  ejecting me; the second cost me a large sum of money, because somehow or
  other I found I had <i>bought</i> the vehicle in question. This I fancy
  must have been occasioned by my turning over two pages at once, so that I
  suppose I really said, "Mr. X., you are an honest man; I will give you
  ten thousand francs, but on condition that you furnish splinter-bars and
  traces also for that price."</p>

  <p>Still one must pay for one's pleasures, and once <i>en route</i> I
  made short work of the "What-may-happen-on-the-road" section. The
  sentence from which I anticipated most trouble was this: "Postilion,
  stop. A spoke of one of the wheels is broken; some of the harness is
  undone; a spring is also broken and one of the horses' shoes is come
  off." I got out all this (without having to tell a lie too) and was just
  looking feverishly through the book to find phrases to describe the
  ricketty state of every other part of the vehicle when the off hind-wheel
  came in half, the front axle snapped and the carriage rolled over on its
  side stone dead. When I came to myself I found that I was comfortably
  seated in a ditch, my driver beside me and my Vade Mecum still open in my
  hand; so I had the gratification of being able to continue the
  conversation where I had left off. "We should do well," I read, "to get
  out."</p>

  <p>I will not detain you long over the difficulties that I had with the
  "Society" section. But I feel I ought to mention the business of the
  Countess, if only to put intending players on their guard. There is a
  puzzling phrase which occurs in answer to the observation, "Pray come
  nearer the fire; I am sure you must be cold." The proper answer is, "No,
  I thank you. I am very well placed here beside the Countess." It took me
  a month to find a Countess, two to meet her in the drawing-room of a
  mutual friend, and four to recover from the hole which the irascible
  little Count made in me when we met next morning on the field of
  honour.</p>

  <p>So I pass sadly and with tears of chagrin to my ultimate defeat. I met
  my Waterloo, my friends, in the section labelled "The Tailor." Requests
  within reason I can comply with, for the fun of the thing. Eatables and
  drinks, suites of rooms and carriages, when ordered on the lavish scale
  of my Vade Mecum, are not exactly <i>cheap</i> now-a-days. But it's about
  the limit when one's Mecum expects one to squander the savings of a
  lifetime in ordering several suits of clothes at once. And yet there it
  was as large as life, the accursed sentence that made me shut the book
  with a snap and come home:&mdash;"These coats fit me well, though the cut
  is not fashionable. I shall require also three pairs of trousers, three
  nankeen pantaloons and four waistcoats."</p>

  <p>If anyone feels inclined to try my patience&mdash;and theirs&mdash;I
  should like to mention that I have a nice annotated Mecum and a good
  second-hand carriage for disposal at a very moderate figure.</p>

<h2>A VICTIM OF FASHION.</h2>

  <p>Like everybody else that one knows, Kidger is an ex-service man.
  During the last year of that war on the Continent some time ago he had
  the acting rank of captain, as second in command of a six-mangle army
  laundry.</p>

  <p>When I knew him in pre-war days he was an amiable character, with only
  two serious weaknesses. One of these was an exaggerated fastidiousness
  about clothes, and the other an undue deference to the dicta of the
  Press. A leader in <i>The Tailor and Cutter</i> would make him thoughtful
  for days. This fatal concern about clothing amounted to a mania where
  neckwear was concerned.</p>

  <p>In pre-war days he wore the ordinary single, perpendicular variety of
  collar, with sharp turn-over points, starched and white to match his
  shirts.</p>

  <p>Before leaving England to join his laundry, Kidger, with a magnificent
  gesture, abandoned his fine collection of collars to his aunt, bidding
  her convert them to some patriotic end. The fond lady, however, fearing
  lest anything should befall her nephew if a hot sector of the line moved
  up to the laundry, preserved them carefully, and Kidger was very glad to
  reclaim them on his demobilisation.</p>

  <p>One unfortunate day Kidger's morning paper contained one of those
  Fashions for Men columns, where he learned that the best people were
  wearing only soft collars, as they couldn't stand being cooped up in
  starch after the freedom of uniform. Kidger felt that as an ex-army man
  it was up to him to maintain any military tradition, and he immediately
  bought several dozen, soft white collars with long sharp points. The
  fellow in the shop said they were correct.</p>

  <p>A week later another expert mentioned in print that no man who had any
  self-respect wore collars with sharp corners.</p>

  <p>Kidger is not a manual worker. He reduced his cigarette allowance and
  bought some round-cornered ones, white as before. And then his aunt
  directed the poor fellow's attention to <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span> a paragraph by an authority
  signing himself "The Colonel," which stated that none but the profiteer
  was wearing white collars, and that you might know the man who had done
  his bit by the fact that he wore a blue one with slightly rounded
  corners, accompanied by a self-coloured tie of a darker shade, tied in a
  neat butterfly bow.</p>

  <p>This was a blow to Kidger, but he resigned from his golf club and laid
  in some haberdashery in accordance with "The Colonel's" orders.
  Recommendations would be too mild a word. I saw the paragraph&mdash;most
  peremptory.</p>

  <p>But in a rival paper "Brigadier" mentioned only three days later that
  none but the most noxious bounder and tout would be found dead in a blue
  collar with a white shirt. Kidger saw the truth of this at once; he had
  receptivity if not intuition. After a trying interview with his banker he
  bought several blue shirts.</p>

  <p>Then the General who contributes "Sartorial Tips" to several leading
  journals remarked that, since all kinds of people were wearing coloured
  shirts and collars, the man who desired to retain or achieve that touch
  of distinction which means so much must at any cost wear white ones; and
  that, further, Society was frowning on the slovenly unstarched neck-wear
  of the relapsed temporary gentleman.</p>

  <p>Kidger began to show signs of neurasthenia. His stock of pre-war
  collars was exhausted, or rather eroded. His faithful aunt, however,
  remembered a neglected birthday and gave him a dozen new ones, of the
  up-and-down model, to save Kidger's delicate neck. These, with his nice
  butterfly-bow ties, looked really well, and Kidger recovered his old
  form.</p>

  <p>I warned him to keep to the police and Parliamentary news in the
  papers, but his eyes would wander. The result was that he learned from
  "Brigade Major" that the wearing of a butterfly bow with a double event
  collar was a solecism past forgiveness or repentance, and that its smart
  appearance was the deadly bait which caught the miserable bumpkin who
  ignorantly fancied that a man could dress by the light of nature.</p>

  <p>Kidger collapsed. His aunt volunteered to sell her annuity and help
  him, but the innate nobility of the man forbade him to accept this
  useless sacrifice.</p>

  <p>His medical attendant tells me that he is now allowed to read only
  poetry, wearing a sweater meanwhile, and that arrangements are being made
  for him to join a sheep-farming cousin in Patagonia, where collars are
  despised and newspapers invariably out of date.</p>

<h3>EDWARD AND THE B.O.F.</h3>

  <p>It was the first Sunday of the season, and the select end of
  Folkesbourne revealed in each carefully curled geranium leaf, in each
  carefully-combed blade of grass, the thought and labour expended by the
  B.O.F. (Borough of Folkesbourne).</p>

  <p>Upon the greensward stood orderly rows of well-washed chairs, each
  with B.O.F. neatly stencilled upon its back. On this day, however, and at
  this hour (12.30 <font class="sc">p.m.</font>) scarce a B.O.F. was
  visible; each was hidden by a well-dressed visitor. And between the
  orderly rows of well-dressed visitors paraded orderly pairs of
  superbly-dressed visitors.</p>

  <p>I was standing at the corner by the steps leading to the lower parade
  and thence to the beach and the rocks where the common people (myself on
  week-days, for instance) go to paddle with their children. I was wearing
  my new pale-grey suit which cost&mdash;but you will know more or less
  what it cost; I need not labour an unpleasant subject&mdash;and I was
  actually talking at the time to a member of the B.O.F.</p>

  <p>"This is Peace at last," he was saying; "the place really begins to
  look&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Edward appeared. His route was the very
  centre of the lawn. He was wearing a battered Panama hat, a much-darned
  brownish jersey, and his nether man&mdash;or rather boy, for Edward's
  years are but four&mdash;was encased in paddling drawers made of the same
  material as a sponge-bag. Black sand-shoes completed his outfit, and a
  broken shrimping-net trailed behind him. At the moment when Edward first
  caught my horrified eye a particularly well-groomed young gentleman of
  about his own age caught Edward's eye in turn. Edward paused to survey
  this silken wonder with interest. Then, as if prompted thereto by the
  sight, he snatched off his hat and, casting it upon the ground, kicked it
  vigorously across the grass.</p>

  <p>The removal of the hat was the last straw, for Edward's hair is
  provocatively red. My friend of the B.O.F. advanced towards him with the
  intention of exerting authority and restoring discipline. Edward turned
  at the sound of a stern voice. Possibly he might have put out his
  tongue&mdash;you never know with Edward. But, what was worse, far worse,
  he saw me. With a glad cry of "Daddy" he rushed to me and, regardless of
  the fact that his front was covered with green slime, the result of going
  <i>ventre à pierre</i> over the rocks, he flung his arms round my
  legs.</p>

  <p>I would gladly have sunk into the ground. All eyes were upon us, and
  remained, as I felt, upon me, even when a breathless nursery-maid had
  retrieved Edward and borne him seawards once more.</p>

  <p>One especially I had noticed, a very superbly dressed female visitor
  who had paused to witness the whole scene and was now resuming her
  promenade. I dreaded the comment which I felt I should overhear as she
  passed me&mdash;"What a horrible child!" it would be at the very least.
  But women are strangely unaccountable, even in so highly civilised an
  atmosphere as this. I distinctly heard her say, "What a darling!"</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

  <p>I rather wish that the publishers of <i>Invincible Minnie</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>) had not permitted themselves to
  print upon the wrapper either their own comments or those of Miss <font
  class="sc">Elisabeth Sanxay Holding</font>, the author. Because for my
  part, reading these, I formed the idea (entirely wrong) that the book
  would be in some way pretentious and affected; whereas it is the simple
  truth to call it the most mercilessly impersonal piece of fiction that I
  think I ever read. There is far too much plot for me to give you any but
  a suggestion of it. The story is of the lives of two sisters,
  <i>Frances</i> and <i>Minnie</i>; mostly (as the title implies) of
  <i>Minnie</i>. To say that no one but a woman would have dared to imagine
  such a heroine, much less to follow her, through every phase of
  increasing hatefulness, to her horrid conclusion is to state an obvious
  truism. It is incidentally also to give you some idea of the kind of
  person <i>Minnie</i> is, that female Moloch, devastating,
  all-sacrificing, beyond restraint.... As for Miss <font
  class="sc">Holding</font>, the publishers turned out to be within the
  mark in claiming for her "a new voice." I don't, indeed, for the moment
  recall any voice in the least like it, or any such method; too honest for
  irony, too detached for sentiment and, as I said above, entirely
  merciless. Towards the end I found myself falling back on the old
  frightened protest, "People don't do these things." I still cling to this
  belief, but the fact remains that Miss <font class="sc">Holding</font>
  has a haunting trick of persuading one that they might. Minor faults,
  such as an irritating idiom and some carelessness of form, she will no
  doubt correct; meanwhile you have certainly got to read&mdash;"to suffer"
  would be the apter word&mdash;this remarkable book, whose reception I
  await with curiosity.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A much misunderstood man is Count <font class="sc">Bernstorff</font>,
  formerly German Ambassador at Washington. While we were all supposing him
  to be a bomb-laden conspirator, pulling secret strings in Mexico or
  Canada or Japan from the safe protection afforded to his embassy, really
  he was the most innocent of men, anxious for nothing but to keep
  unsophisticated America from being trapped by the wiles of the villain
  Britisher. One has it all on the best of authority&mdash;his own&mdash;in
  <i>My Three Years in America</i> (<font class="sc">Skeffington</font>).
  Of course awkward incidents did occur, which have to be explained away or
  placidly ignored, but really, if the warlords at home had not been so
  invincibly tactless in the matter of drowning citizens of the United
  States, this simple and ingenuous diplomat might very well have
  succeeded, he would have us believe, in persuading President <font
  class="sc">Wilson</font> to declare in favour of a peace-loving
  All-Highest. As an essay in special pleading the book does not lack
  ingenuity, and as an example of the familiar belief that other peoples
  will shut their eyes and swallow whatever opinions the Teuton thinks good
  to offer them, it may have interest for the psychologist. For the rest it
  is a very prosy piece of literature, only saved occasionally in its
  dulness by the unconscious crudity of the hatreds lurking beneath its
  mask of plausibility. One of these hatreds is clearly directed against
  Ambassador <font class="sc">Gerard</font>, to whose well-known book this
  volume is in some sort a counter-blast. Neither a historian seeking truth
  nor a plain reader seeking recreation will have any difficulty in
  choosing between them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. D.A. <font class="sc">Barker</font>, in <i>The Great Leviathan</i>
  (<font class="sc">Lane</font>), doesn't merely leave you to make the
  obvious remark about his having taken Mr. H.G. <font
  class="sc">Well's</font> loose, tangential and, for a beginner,
  extraordinarily dangerous method as a model, <span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> but rubs it in (stout
  fellow!) by transplanting his hero to India, seemingly in order to have
  excuse for writing a passage which one would say was obviously inspired
  by that gorgeous description of the jungle in <i>The Research
  Magnificent</i>. Mr. <font class="sc">Barker</font> has enough matter for
  two (or three) novels and enough skill in portraiture to make them more
  coherent and plausible than this. The theme is old but freshly seen.
  <i>Tom Seton</i>, resolved to avoid risking for his beloved the
  unhappiness which his mother had found in the bondage of marriage, offers
  her&mdash;indeed imposes on her&mdash;a free union. How the pressure of
  <i>The Great Leviathan</i> (<i>Mrs. Grundy</i>&mdash;well, that's not
  perhaps quite the whole of the idea, but it will serve) drove her into
  the shelter of a formal marriage with a devoted don, I leave you to
  gather. I don't think the author quite succeeds in making <i>Mary's</i>
  defection inevitable, nor do I see the significance of the apparently
  quite irrelevant background of Indian philosophy and intrigue. But here's
  a well-written book, with sound positive qualities outweighing the
  defects of inexperience.</p>

  <p>Captain <font class="sc">Alan Bott</font> ("Contact") has a literary
  gift of a high order, the gift of getting the very last thrill out of his
  experiences while telling his tale in the simplest and most
  straightforward way. In <i>Eastern Nights</i> (<font
  class="sc">Blackwood</font>) he describes his adventures as a prisoner of
  the Turks, first in Damascus and Asia Minor and finally in
  Constantinople. The narrative, which is purely one of action, the action
  being supplied by the efforts, finally successful, of the author and
  various brother-officers to escape from their most unattractive
  captivity, nevertheless offers a most vivid picture of the social fabric
  of the Near East and in particular of the attitude of the <i>mélange</i>
  of Oriental peoples that comprised the Turkish Empire towards the War in
  which they found themselves taking part, most of them with reluctance and
  all inefficiently. Apathy rather than calculated brutality was chiefly
  responsible for the hardships suffered by the prisoners of war of all
  nations who were unfortunate enough to fall into Turkish hands. From the
  point of view of an officer determined to escape, however, the prevalence
  of this quality was not without its advantage. Most of the officials
  (Turks and Germans excepted) with whom Captain <font
  class="sc">Bott</font> and his fellow-officers had to do were pro-Ally at
  heart and ready enough to assist an escaping prisoner if they did not
  happen to be too timid. And even the Turk was amenable on occasion to
  baksheesh. Altogether a most fascinating book, <i>Eastern Nights</i> is
  likely to win wide appreciation not alone for its literary merit but as a
  stirring record of the courage and resource, under desperate and trying
  conditions, of the Empire's soldiers.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Miss <font class="sc">Henrietta Leslie</font> belongs to the school of
  novelists who believe in telling you all about their characters and
  leaving you to pass judgment on them yourself, without expert assistance.
  It is a fine impartial method which succeeds in representing life and the
  indecisiveness of human nature very well; but such books somehow lack the
  glow of more partisan writings. In <i>A Mouse with Wings</i> (<font
  class="sc">Collins</font>) she tells the story of a woman's life from the
  time of her engagement until her son is a young man and she herself
  married again. <i>Olga</i> is a splendid creature, but, as Miss <font
  class="sc">Leslie</font> cleverly lets you see for yourself, the belief
  in her own principles and their application, which is the essence of her
  character, alienates her husband and makes something like a ninny of
  <i>Arnold</i>, her son. <i>A Mouse with Wings</i> is not only the
  sobriquet of <i>Beryl</i>, the cheerful young Suffragette whom he loves,
  but has its application also to poor <i>Arnold</i>, who finds the courage
  to face life and a way out of it fighting in France. It is a
  nicely-written book with a little air of distinction, but, in case anyone
  should blame me for hushing it up, I ought to mention that both
  <i>Olga</i> and <i>Beryl</i> would probably have admired <i>Arnold</i> a
  great deal more had he "found himself" by way of Conscientious
  Objection.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>I can testify that Mr. <font class="sc">Zane Grey's</font> <i>The Man
  of the Forest</i> (<font class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>) is a
  yarn told with considerable zest and with just that undercurrent of
  sentiment which sweeps large portions of the British public completely
  off its feet. In this book the heroine, <i>Helen Rayner</i>, and her
  sister, <i>Bo</i>, leave Missouri for their uncle's ranch in New Mexico;
  but before they reach their destination many and wonderful adventures
  befall them. To escape from being kidnapped by some superb scoundrels
  they were hustled off to <i>Milt Dale's</i> home in the forest, and there
  they had for a long time to remain. <i>Milt</i> was one of nature's
  gentlemen, but as his boon companion was a cougar (whose uninviting
  picture is to be seen upon the paper cover), this forest home had its
  slight inconveniences. Mr. <font class="sc">Grey</font>, however, writes
  of it so admirably that he almost persuades me to be a camper-out,
  provided always that I may live in a cavern and not in a caravan.
  Cowboys, bandits, Mormons and other vigorous characters keep things
  moving at a terrific pace. But stirringly full of incident as this tale
  is, Mr. <font class="sc">Grey</font> never forgets that it is love that
  really makes the world go round. He is in short a born storyteller, with
  a style by no means to be despised, and I see no reason why his
  popularity should not continue to wax here, and ultimately to rival its
  American magnitude.</p>

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
